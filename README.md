# Simple-KAN: A Polynomial Approach to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Symbolic Computation
This repository contains files to replicate all results of the SimpleKAN paper. 

## KAN_funcs.jl
This file contains all files necessary to create SimpleKAN models and compute outputs. It can be copied into a user's project directory and included into a file using the include() function. It will give the user the ability to create and use SimpleKAN models that are compatible with the Flux package.

## Performance Demonstration Files
These files can be directly run without modification to reproduce the results in the paper.
